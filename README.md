 This widget is an attractive steampunk Yahoo widget for your desktop. It 
 displays a continuous time update on your desktop. It is based upon Nixie tubes 
 that were used as status indicators/displays in the 50/60s - 70s. This Widget 
 is a moveable widget that you can move anywhere around the desktop as you 
 require. New about us page, repositions properly on tablet devices in 
 portrait/landscape mode. Can be locked by clicking on the second tube.

 The widget can be resized - Hover the cursor over the widget. Press the CTRL key 
 and use your mousewheel up or down. The widget will resize dynamically.
 
 All javascript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
 the Yahoo Widget Konfabulator engine. The engine interprets the javascript and 
 creates the widget according to the XML description and using the images you 
 provide.
